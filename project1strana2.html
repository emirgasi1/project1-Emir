            <pre>GitHub’s chief legal officer, Shelley McKinley, has plenty on her plate,<br>what with legal wrangles around its Copilot pair-progammer,as well as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, <br>which was voted through the European Parliament this week as “the world’s first comprehensive AI law.”</pre>        
            <pre>Three years in the making, the EU AI Act first reared its head back in 2021 via proposals designed<br>to address the growing reach of AI into our everyday lives. The new legal framework is set to govern <br>AI applications based on their perceived risks, with different rules and stipulations depending on the application and use-case.</pre>
            <pre>GitHub, which Microsoft bought for $7.5 billion in 2018, has emerged as one of the most vocal naysayers around one very specific <br>element of the regulations: muddy wording on how the rules might create legal liability for open source software developers.</pre>
            <pre>McKinley joined Microsoft in 2005, serving in various legal roles including hardware businesses such as Xbox and Hololens, <br>as well as general counsel positions based in Munich and Amsterdam,<br>before landing in the Chief Legal officer hotseat at GitHub coming up for three years ago.</pre>
            <pre>“I moved over to GitHub in 2021 to take on this role, which is a little bit different to some <br>Chief Legal Officer roles — this is multidisciplinary,” McKinley told TechCrunch. <br>“So I’ve got standard legal things like commercial contracts, product, and HR issues. <br>And then I have accessibility, so [that means] driving our accessibility mission, <br>which means all developers can use our tools and services to create stuff.”</pre>
            <pre>McKinley is also tasked with overseeing environmental sustainability, <br>which ladders directly up to Microsoft’s own sustainability goals. <br>And then there are issues related to trust and safety, which covers <br>things like moderating content to ensure that “GitHub remains a welcoming, <br>safe, positive place for developers,” as McKinley puts it.</pre>
            <pre>Ahead of the EU AI Act getting the greenlight this week, TechCrunch caught up with McKinley in London.</pre>
