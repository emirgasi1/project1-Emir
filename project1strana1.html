            <pre>LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social platform, has made a name for itself primarily as a<br>platform for people looking to network and pick up knowledge for professional purposes,<br>and for recruitment — a business that now has more 1 billion users.<br>Now, to boost the time people are spending on the platform, <br>the company is breaking into a totally new area: gaming.</pre>        
            <pre>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that LinkedIn is working on a new games experience.<br>It will be doing so by tapping into the same wave of puzzle-mania that helped simple <br>games like Wordle find viral success and millions of players. Three early<br>efforts are games called “Queens”, “Inference” and “Crossclimb.”</pre>
            <pre>App researchers have started to find code that points to the work LinkedIn is doing.<br>One of them, <a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji">Nima Owji</a>, said that one idea LinkedIn appears to be experimenting with <br>involves player scores being organised by places of work, with companies getting “ranked” <br>by those scores.</pre>
            <pre>A spokesperson for LinkedIn has confirmed that it is working on gaming, but said there is as yet no launch date.</pre>
            <pre>“We’re playing with adding puzzle-based games within the LinkedIn experience to unlock a <br>bit of fun, deepen relationships, and hopefully spark the opportunity for conversations,” <br>the spokesperson said in a message to TechCrunch. “Stay tuned for more!”</pre>
            <pre>The spokesperson added that the images shared by the researcher on X are not the latest versions.</pre>
